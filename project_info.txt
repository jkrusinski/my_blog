To-Do:

1. Creating the Git Repository
2. Cloning the Git Repository
3. Creating some files
    index.php - main page that lists all the posts
    view_post.php - page to view one post
    edit_post.php - page to create or edit a post

Implementation:
    1. Create a database schema (define the structure of the database)
        -What tables are we going to need?
        -What columns will they have?
        -What are the relationships between the tables?
        -Are there any columns in one table that correspond to columns in another?
    2. Create INCLUDE File
        -Access to database
        -General functions
        -Classes
        -Write db_info.php that contains the MySQL server name, username, password, and database name.
    3. Implement Post Insertion
        FRONT END:
            -Create edit_post.php and include db_info.php
            -Form with a text box for author, a huge text box for the post body, and a submit button.
            -Some text with directions on how to create/edit a post.
        BACK END:
            -Check if form was submitted
            -Grab values from the text fields
            -Input validation
            -Insert a new row into the database
    4. Reading
        FRONT END:
            -Create index.php and include db_info.php
            -create HTML tags for the page layout but no styling yet
        BACK END:
            -Select all blog posts from MySQL
            -Iterate through the result with 'foreach' and display each post
                *title, date, author, and post body
    5. Searching
        -Create a search form with 1 text box and a submit button
        -When form is submitted, run a SELECT query with a WHERE that


        ...
